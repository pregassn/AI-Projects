This is directory is the work of the student Nirmal PREGASSAME for the 1st assignement of the subject Practical Machine Learning.
This README.txt explains the structure of the directory.

The Main file answering the problem of the assignement is the pdf or the Word documents (Same content):
_  Practical Machine Learning Assignment 1.pdf
_  Practical Machine Learning Assignment 1.docx


The main scripts in Python for which the kNN Algorithn has been implemented and which have been used to launch and get the result are:
_ KNN_assignment_part1_2.py : For the Part 1 and the Part 2 of the assignment
_ KNN_assignment_part3.py : For the Part 3 of the assignment


The directories "cancer2" and "regressionData" are provided by the lecturer as inputs for the python code and the kNN Algorithm.

The following directory:
_ results 
is an an important directory since it contains all the results of the kNN algorithm for the 3 parts of the assignment.

The main result to see is :
_ results/KNN_Assignment_results.xlsx

This xls sheet contains the presentation of the result of :
_ Part 1 and 2, in the KNN_Assignment_part1_2.out tab 
_ Part 3, in the KNN_Assignment_part3.out tab



The other files in "results" directory are:
_ results/KNN_Assignment_part1_2.out.txt: the original output of the run for part 1 and 2
_ results/KNN_Assignment_part3.out.txt: the original output of the run for part 3
_ results/KNN_Assignment_part1_2.out.csv: the csv format of the output of the run for part 1 and 2
_ results/KNN_Assignment_part3.out.csv: the csv format of the output of the run for part 3
