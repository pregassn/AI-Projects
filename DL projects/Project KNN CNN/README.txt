This is directory is the work of the student Nirmal PREGASSAME for the 1st assignement of the Deep Learning module.
This README.txt explains the structure of the directory.

The Main file which is the reports of the assignement is the Word documents:
_  DL_Assignment1_report.docx : This reports has 3 Parts (A-Tensorflow, B-Keras, C-Research) and explains the code and the result of the projects.


Results on Part A is located in the directories:
_ Part A - TensorFlow\IPYNB files  : In this directory you will see 3 files in ipynb format
		> DL_Assignment1_Part_A_I_.ipynb: ipynb source code of Part A -I
		> DL_Assignment1_Part_A_II_.ipynb: ipynb source code of Part A -II
		> DL_Assignment1_Part_A_III_.ipynb: ipynb source code of Part A -III

_ Part A - TensorFlow\Python files : In this directory you will see 3 files in Python format (the content should beidentical to the ipynb format file)
		> dl_assignment1_part_a_i_.py: Python source code of Part A -I
		> dl_assignment1_part_a_ii_.py: Python source code of Part A -II
		> dl_assignment1_part_a_iii_.py: Python source code of Part A -III



Results on Part B is located in the directories:
_ Part B - TensorFlow\IPYNB files  : In this directory you will see 3 files in ipynb format
		> DL_Assignment1_Part_B_I_.ipynb: ipynb source code of Part B -I
		> DL_Assignment1_Part_B_II_.ipynb: ipynb source code of Part B -II
		> DL_Assignment1_Part_B_III_.ipynb: ipynb source code of Part B -III

_ Part B - TensorFlow\Python files : In this directory you will see 3 files in Python format (the content should beidentical to the ipynb format file)
		> dl_assignment1_part_b_i_.py: Python source code of Part B -I
		> dl_assignment1_part_b_ii_.py: Python source code of Part B -II
		> dl_assignment1_part_b_iii_.py: Python source code of Part B -III
