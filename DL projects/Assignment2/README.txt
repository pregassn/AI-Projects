########################################


This is directory is the work of the student Nirmal PREGASSAME for the 2nd assignement of the Deep Learning module.
This README.txt explains the structure of the directory.

The Main file which is the reports of the assignement is the Word documents:
_  DL_Assignment2_report.docx : This reports has 3 Parts (A-CNN, B-Transfer Learning, C-Research) and explains the code and the result of the projects.
_  DL_Assignment2_report.pdf  : This reports is in pdf format and should be identical to the docx report.


Results on Part A is located in the directories:
_ Part A - Part A - CNN\IPYNB files  : In this directory you will see the ipynb format file
		> DL_Assignment2_Part_A.ipynb: ipynb source code of all the Part A

_ Part A - TensorFlow\Python files : In this directory you will see the Python format file (the content should beidentical to the ipynb format file)
		> dl_assignment2_part_a.py: Python source code of all Part A
		


Results on Part B is located in the directories:
_ Part B - Part B - Transfer Learning\IPYNB files  : In this directory you will see the ipynb format file
		> DL_Assignment2_Part_B.ipynb: ipynb source code of all the Part B

_ Part B - TensorFlow\Python files : In this directory you will see the Python format file (the content should beidentical to the ipynb format file)
		> dl_assignment2_part_b.py: Python source code of all Part B
